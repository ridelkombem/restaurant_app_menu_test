Web Restaurant

This is a screenshot of pages from the restaurant menu test app
I used the document and put all the various types of meals into categories and put each sub under as a meal which has a subsequent set of ingredients used to make the meal. I used the riverpod state management system to add a favorite feature and a filter feature which is lactose free, vegan etc based on the choice of the user.
